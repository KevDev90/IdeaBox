# Idea box

### Introduction to the Project
This was our first group project (three team members) in Mod 1 at Turing School of Software and Design. We started this project on 10/21/19 and finished on 10/30/19. Our team was given an example composition with specific colors, fonts, images, and a desktop/mobile design involving media queries with functionality to recreate. Our team used HTML, CSS, and two JavaScript files. One file for our 'Idea' class the other file to handle all our functionality. We really enjoyed building this app and writing code for functionality that we were not familiar with. This was our first time working with local storage within the user's browser as well as search functionality. The most challenging element of the project was writing the functions that would update object properties in local storage in real-time when a user favorited or deleted a card.

### Project Summary
This project is an app that allows users to create "Idea Cards" on the DOM that consist of a title and description of the idea. The user had the ability to favorite or delete specific cards. The "Save Card" button remains deactivated until the user inputs data into both text fields. When the user selects the favorite/star property on the top-left of any card, it is reflected in the local storage. When the user refreshes the web page, the user's cards save and repopulate upon reload. The delete card function is also reflected in the local storage in the same way. There is a search function allowing the user to search (without case sensitivity) in real-time with each keystroke.
